# Slowlane
## Description
> The philosophy is never to be clever but the user in control and ask him to clarify rather than making a clever choice.

it's like [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools) but without the magic.

## Why ? 

Fastlane is great but it makes a lot of assumptions:
- hey let's sync all your provisioning profiles
- when you add a device, let's add it to all provisioning profiles by default
- let's use a fastfile
- let's store your user:password in your keychain
- ....

Don't get us wrong, we think fastlane is  **great** , but we are one of those who don't like suprises.

We leverage 'spaceship' library and will continue to work on that to have a shared 

## Status
Real alpha , as we are still exploring the spaceship api
